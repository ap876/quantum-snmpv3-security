# Application of Quantum Cryptography for Securing Network Management Protocols

This repository was created as part of the **Masterâ€™s thesis at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo**.  
The work focuses on the integration of **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** with the **SNMPv3** protocol, aiming to enhance the security of network management communications in the quantum era.  

A simulation environment was developed based on the **NS-3/QKDNetSim** emulator, Python implementations of SNMPv3 agents and managers, and Key Management System (KMS) servers.  
Several scenarios were analyzed, covering QKD key consumption, response time (RTT), efficiency of SNMP operations, and encryption/decryption performance.
